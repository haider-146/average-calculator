# Average-calculator
The project involves developing an average calculator using basic C++ programming. The application prompts users to specify the number of inputs they wish to provide. Based on the user's response, the program then requests the corresponding number of numerical inputs. After collecting these inputs, the program computes and displays the average value of the entered integers.
